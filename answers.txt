#### Answer These Questions
Once you have successfully run a simulation, use your python skills to answer to analyze the simulation results

1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate,  reproductive rate)

Population size: 10,000
Percent Vaccinated: 90%
virus name: HIV
mortality rate: 25%
reproductive rate: 10%

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

5% due to most of the population being vaccinated

3.  What percentage of the population died from the virus?

1%

4.  Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

90% of the interactions
